<p>Let's say you have a poll. Your customers don't know to scroll to the bottom of the poll to submit the whole poll, and frequently fall into the hole of not submitting the whole poll.</p>
<p>That's not the goal! Take control of the scroll with <b>jankyscroll.js</b>! Don't just let them stroll through the poll - control the scroll. Don't let the scroll take it's toll.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="jankyscroll.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The sole goal of any poll is to enroll the whole soul in the role of poll patrol. To properly patrol the poll, you have to cajole a soul into scrolling through the whole poll. How can a soul be cajoled into scrolling a poll if the poll to be strolled isn't whole? To patrol this goal's role, we extol the virtues of <b>jankyscroll</b>.</p>

<p>It's important to indicate to users that there's more content on the page than meets the eye. That's why <b>jankyscroll</b> stutters randomly. It's on purpose. </p>
