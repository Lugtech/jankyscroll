<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to <u>jankyscroll</u>.</h3>

<p>Let's say you have a poll. Your customers are idiots, and sometimes fall into the hole of not knowing how to scroll to the bottom of the poll, mistaking a part of the poll for the whole. We know that's not the goal of the poll! </p>
<p>Take control of the scroll with <u>jankyscroll</u>! Don't just let them stroll through the poll - control the scroll. Don't let the scroll take its toll.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="jankyscroll.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The team that built <u>jankyscroll</u> understands the sole goal of the poll: to cajole a soul to patrol the whole poll. But if the poll to be scrolled isn't whole, control of the stroll's in a hole! To patrol the goal of the poll, we extole the role of <u>jankyscroll</u>.</p>

<p>It's important to indicate to users that there's more content on the page than meets the eye. That's why <u>jankyscroll</u> stutters randomly. It's on purpose. Shut up.</p>
